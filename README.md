# "BMI Calculation App By Java Swing"

This is a basic implementation of a bmi calculator app with the help of java swing. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in meters (m). 
This simple app with its user friendly UI allows you to calculate your BMI by simply entering your height and weight in the boxes. The app contains 3 main panels:
## 1.  Welcome Panel
This is the first panel that pops up when you run the app. You can basically start the calculation app from here or go to the settings as shown bellow:

## 2. Setting Panel
In this panel you can basically change the color theme of the entire app (Dark or Light mode) and you could go back to the Welcome Panel by simply pressing the "back" button:

## 3. Calculation Panel
This panel holds the real purpose of the app, which is calculating the BMI. There are two boxes labeled as "height" and "weight" that you need to fill in. And of course there is also the "back" button in the Calculation Panel that takes you back to the Welcome Panel:

After you've entered your height and weight, you can click on the "calculate your bmi" button and the app generates the calculated bmi number and displays it:

Keep in mind that the app is designed to be simple and functional. It might look "basic" or "ugly" you might say, but it does the job perfectly. Just enter your weight and height, and get your bmi right away! :D
